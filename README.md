## 📋 Project Overview  
This project was completed during my **internship at Datamites** as part of a hands-on assignment on **data analytics and visualization**.  

Datamites provided a **single database named `job_market_analysis`**, which contained **42 columns** with detailed job market information such as job titles, companies, locations, salaries, skills, and industries.

I performed the following steps:
1. **Extracted the raw data** from the `job_market_analysis` database.  
2. **Cleaned, standardized, and transformed** the dataset using **MySQL Workbench**.  
3. **Exported the cleaned dataset** into Power BI for visualization and analysis.  
4. **Built interactive dashboards** to identify market trends, top-paying roles, and in-demand skills.

The final dashboard helps understand hiring trends in the **Data Science & Analytics** domain and supports data-driven career insights.
